# Wealth-Distribution-and-Social-Mobility

Economic Inequality refers to the unequal distribution of income and subsequent opportunities between different groups in society.

The basic functioning of the model is as described below -

</p>

Additional Features -
  1. Government Policies - progressive taxation system
  2. Seasonal availability of grains
  3. Intergenerational mobility - the inheritance of wealth by the offspring
 
By extending the original NetLogo ABM using the above features, this model aims to mirror an existing economy in order to visualize wealth distribution and subsequent social economic mobility. 
It attempts to answer the following questions -
  1. What measures can be implemented to change the wealth distribution?
  2. Can the above measures be used to achieve wealth equality? And if so, to what extent?
